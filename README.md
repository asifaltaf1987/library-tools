### What is Coconut?
The coconut tree is known as one of the most useful trees. 🌴 The leaves function to produce oxygen through photosynthesis and are used for handicrafts, even for roof houses. The shells, the oil, the wood, the flowers, or even the husks can be something useful.  

We saw a gap in access to appropriate technology and gadgets in numerous areas (particularly in small countries and remote regions), and not all librarians can program. Some also have limited resources (such as low memory or ancient PCs).

From Coconut's philosophy, this app aims to be useful for librarians or anyone who needs cool features but is hindered by programming languages.

We thank the cool people who have created so many facilities that we can place them in a place. We can't name them all, but we believe science will advance due to your efforts. 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾
